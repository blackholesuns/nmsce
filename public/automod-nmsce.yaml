    Thank You for posting your {{match-flair_text}} to /r/{{subreddit}}. Your post has been set for moderator review. Please be patient until a (human) moderator has a chance to review this post. This post was automatically flagged because it appears you used the word "black" to describe this starship.

    * If you only used the word "black" to describe smaller trim pieces, there is a good chance your post **WILL** be approved.

    * However, if you  used the word "black" to describe the overall color of this starship, there is a good chance this post **WILL NOT** be approved. Especially if your photo has poor lighting...

    See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NMSCoordinateExchange/comments/d0ljoz/psa_black_ships_aside_from_freighters_do_not/) for more information.

    * Please do not contact the moderators to ask when your post will be approved. Moderators are not always available to approve a post so please be patient.

    Thank You for posting your {{match-flair_text}} to /r/{{subreddit}}. Your post has been removed because we're trying to keep confusing and misleading information given to new users to a minimum. Thank you for helping us with this.

    * The class of a ship and its exact slot count are only valid for a *crashed* ship. For any other ship location, ship class and slot count is entirely *random* and should NOT be included.
    * Freighter class and slot counts are also *random* based on spawning so should also NOT be included.

    **Please**, repost your {{match-flair_text}} keeping this in mind.

    **How to find Freighters using member submitted coordinates:** 

    **System Freighters** (15-19 inventory slots) can be found by traveling via portal using the coordinates provided in this post. Once you are in the right system, pulse around in space until the correct system freighter spawns.

    **Capital Freighters** (24-34 inventory slots) are slightly more complex to find using member submitted coordinates. See [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/NMSGlyphExchange/comments/zmpc8w/how_to_acquire_capital_freighters_from_member/) for more information.

    **Tips for finding Multi-tools from shared coordinates**

    User error is the most common reason players have difficulty finding Multi-tools from shared coordinates. If you are having troubles locating this MT, please read the tips below! 

    * Turn off multiplayer before going through the portal 
    * Ensure you are in the correct galaxy 
    * Double check that you entered the glyph sequence correctly 
    * Make sure you follow the OP’s instructions exactly 
    * Not every MT is located at the space station 
    * Some MT’s required you to save and reload on a specific planet/moon (or the space station) and then travel to a specific location to acquire the MT
