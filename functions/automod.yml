### add bug comment to bug flair -4/7/21 sp
type: submission
flair_text (includes): "bug"
~flair_text (includes): "thread"
comment: |
    Thank you for posting to r/{{subreddit}}. If you are reporting a bug then please delete this post and place it in the pinned bug report thread. Hello Games reads that post and may miss general bug reports just posted under the general "bug" flair. 

    Please, continue to post using this flair if you wish to discuss a bug or possible bug.
 
    You can also report a bug directly to Hello Games at [Zen Desk](https://hellogames.zendesk.com/).

# add comment for new "answered" flair 4/3/21 -sp
type: submission
flair_text (includes): 'question'
comment: |
    Once you have a satisfactory answer to your question please reset the flair to "answered". This will help others find an answer to the same question.  Selecting a flair is one of the icons under the post when you open it. Alternatively you can comment with "!flair:answered" and the bot will do it for you.

    Please consider adding your gaming platform to your user flair. There are icons for every platform. That way people will know not to answer with information specific to a different platform. There are very few issues that are platform dependent but every platform has its little quirks.

    **If this is a question reporting a bug please delete and place it in the pinned bug report thread. If this is a discussion about a bug or possible bug please change the flair to the more specific "Bug" flair.**
