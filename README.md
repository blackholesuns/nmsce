# Contributing
As of V1.2.0 it is now possible to work on it locally with nothing more than npm installed. 

Do do that checkout the Repository
```
$ git checkout https://github.com/blackholesuns/nmsce
```
and run the development script
```
$ npm run dev
```
Voila. Now it should be available to test under https://localhost:5000
